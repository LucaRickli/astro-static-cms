# Astro Static CMS (WIP)

[Static CMS](https://github.com/StaticJsCMS/static-cms) integration for Astro. Heavily inspired by [@delucis/astro-netlify-cms](https://github.com/delucis/astro-netlify-cms) and works in almost the same way.

This is just a example on how this could be done. It needs some work before its ready for production.

See `test/astro.config.mts` on how this could be used.
